TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. Tensorflow is a symbolic math library based on dataflow and differentiable programming.


TensorFlow Extended(TFX)
--
TensorFlow Extended (TFX) is an end-to-end platform for deploying production ML pipelines. 

A TFX pipeline is a sequence of components that implement an ML pipeline which is specifically designed for scalable, high-performance machine learning tasks. Components are built using TFX libraries which can also be used individually.
