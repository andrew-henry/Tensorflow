Recurrent Neural Networks
--

A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.

Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs.
