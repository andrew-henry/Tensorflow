Keras Functional API
--

The Keras functional API is a way to create models that are more flexible than the tf.keras.Sequential API. The functional API can handle models with non-linear topology, shared layers, and even multiple inputs or outputs

The main idea is that a deep learning model is usually a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of layers. So the functional API is a way to build graphs of layers.
